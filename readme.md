# UIImageDiskCache

UIImageDiskCache is a helper to cache images on disk with additions for UIImage, UIImageView and UIButton.

It supports server cache control policies to re-download images when expired. Server cache control logic is implemented manually instead of using an NSURLCache for performance reasons.

You can also completely ignore server cache control and manually clean-up images yourself.

It's very small at roughly 700+ lines of code in a single header / implementation file.

Everything is asynchronous and uses modern objective-c with libdispatch and NSURLSession.

## Use Case

This isn't intended to compete with other frameworks that are optimized to provide fast scrolling for thousands or tens-of-thousands of images.

For average apps that would like to cache images on disk and have some options to control caching, this will make a noticeable difference.

My particular use case was a better disk cache that isn't NSURLCache. It provides better options for handling how server cache control policies are used. And get rid of delays or flickering that happens because of NSURLCache being slow.

## No Flickering or Noticeable Delayed Loads For Cached Images

Images that are cached and available on disk load into UIImageView or UIButton almost immediatly. This is most noticeable on table view cells.

## Server Cache Policies

It works with servers that support ETag/If-None-Match and Cache-Control headers.

If the server responds with only ETag you can optionally cache the image for a default amount of time. Or don't cache it at all and send requests each time to check for modified content.

If a response is 304 it uses the cached image available on disk.

## Installation

Download, fork, clone or submodule this repo. Then add UIImageDiskCache.h/m to your Xcode project.

## UIImageDiskCache Object

There's a default configured cache which you're free to configure how you like.

````
UIImageDiskCache * cache = [UIImageDiskCache defaultDiskCache];
//set cache properties here.
````

Or you can setup your own and configure it:

````
UIImageDiskCache * cache = [[UIImageDiskCache alloc] init];
//set cache properties here.
````

By default the cache will use server cache control policies. You can disable server cache control:

````
myCache.useServerCachePolicy = FALSE;
````

For responses that return an ETag header but no Cache-Control header you can set a default amount of time to cache those images for:

````
myCache.etagOnlyCacheControl = 604800; //1 week;
myCache.etagOnlyCacheControl = 0;      //(default) always send request to see if there's new content.
````

### Manual Disk Cache Cleanup

If you ignore server cache control you should put some kind of cleanup to remove old files. There are a few helper methods available:

````
- (void) clearCachedFilesOlderThan1Day;
- (void) clearCachedFilesOlderThan1Week;
- (void) clearCachedFilesOlderThan:(NSTimeInterval) timeInterval;
````

These methods use the file modified date to decide which to delete. Images that are used frequently will not be removed. When an image is accessed using the cache the modified date is updated.

Put some cleanup in app delegate:

````
- (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    UIImageDiskCache * cache = [UIImageDiskCache defaultDiskCache];
    [cache clearCachedFilesOlderThan1Week];
}
````

### Loading an Image

It's easy to load an image:

````
UIImageDiskCache * cache = [UIImageDiskCache defaultDiskCache];

NSURL * imageURL;

[cache loadImageWithURL:imageURL hasCache:^(UIImage *image, UIImageLoadSource loadedFromSource) {
	self.imageView.image = image;
} sendRequest:^(BOOL didHaveCachedImage) {
	
} requestCompleted:^(NSError *error, UIImage *image, UIImageLoadSource loadedFromSource) {
	if(loadedFromSource == UIImageLoadSourceNetworkToDisk) {
		self.imageView.image = image;
	}
}];

imageURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/How-To-Change-the-Language-on-Your-iPhone-iPod-touch-2.png"];

[cache loadImageWithURL:imageURL hasCache:^(UIImage *image, UIImageLoadSource loadedFromSource) {
	[self.button setImage:image forState:UIControlStateNormal];
} sendRequest:^(BOOL didHaveCachedImage) {
	
} requestCompleted:^(NSError *error, UIImage *image, UIImageLoadSource loadedFromSource) {
	if(loadedFromSource == UIImageLoadSourceNetworkToDisk) {
		[self.button setImage:image forState:UIControlStateNormal];
	}
}];
````

UIImageView, UIButton, and UIImage have similar additions to load an image.

### UIImageLoadSource

UIImageLoadSource gives you some information about where the image was loaded from:

````
//image source passed in completion callbacks.
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger,UIImageLoadSource) {
	//these will be passed to your hasCache callback
	UIImageLoadSourceDisk,               //image was cached on disk already and loaded from disk
	UIImageLoadSourceMemory,             //image was in memory cache
	
    //these will be passed to your requestCompleted callback
	UIImageLoadSourceNone,               //no source as there was an error
	UIImageLoadSourceNetworkNotModified, //a network request was sent but existing content is still valid
	UIImageLoadSourceNetworkToDisk,      //a network request was sent, image was updated on disk
};
````

### NSURLSession

You can customize the NSURLSession that's used to download images like this:

````
myCache.session = myNSURLSession;
````

If you do change the session, you are responsible for implementing it's delegate if required. And implementing SSL trust for self signed certificates if required.

### NSURLSessionDataTask

Each helper method on UIImage, UIImageView, and UIButton returns an NSURLSessionDataTask. You can either use it or ignore it. It's useful if you ever needed to cancel an image request.

## Other Useful Features

### SSL

If you need to support self signed certificates you can use (false by default):

````
myCache.trustAnySSLCertificate = TRUE;
````

### Auth Basic Password Protected Directories/Images

You can set default user/pass that gets sent in every request with:

````
[myCache setAuthUsername:@"username" password:@"password"];
````
